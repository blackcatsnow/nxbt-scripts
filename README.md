# nxbt-scripts
A collection of scripts I'm working on for use in https://github.com/Brikwerk/nxbt. 

## hatch-box.txt
automatically runs back and forth to hatch eggs and then switches out a new coloumn of eggs, then repeats for the entire box. 
Before starting:
 1. Make sure to have only a flame body pokemon in your party.  
 2. Go to boxes and make sure you are on the box with the eggs then close boxes.
 3. Make sure your cursor is on the pokemon in your party then close the menu by pressing B.
