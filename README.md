A collection of scripts I'm working on for use in https://github.com/Brikwerk/nxbt. 

## hatch-box.txt
automatically runs back and forth to hatch eggs and then switches out a new column of eggs, then repeats for the entire box. 
Before starting:

 1. Go somewhere without anything to run into. I recommend the area zero entrance. 
 2. Make sure to have only a flame body pokemon in your party.
 3. Go to boxes and make sure you are on the box with the eggs then close boxes.
 4. Make sure your cursor is on the pokemon in your party then close the menu by pressing B.

## hatch.txt
Automatically runs back and forth and presses A every two seconds to hatch eggs. I recommend doing this at the area zero entrance. 
You may need to increase or decrease the amount of loops depending on the egg cycles of the pokemon you are hatching. I use this with a flame body pokemon but it is not technically required, you would just have to increase the amount of loops.
